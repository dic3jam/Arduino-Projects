# Arduino-Projects

## Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to allow me to expand upon my knowledge of C programming, microcontrollers, 
electroncis, KiCad, git and github. This repository will contain work on the following projects:

**incrementLED**- simple circuit that with a pushbutton you can single step the brightness on and LED.

**joystickLEDarray**- using a joystick position to correspondingly light an array of LEDs *in progress*

**digitalthermometer**- reads temperature and humidity from a sensor and outputs to a small display *in progresss*

As of this commit this is all I have planned.
